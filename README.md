# Test Development Guide (TDD)
A simple repository that I will use to improve my skills with Unit Test, and TDD. Here, I start learn about TDD, and Unit Tests, wrote my first tests.
I developed this project during a Alura Course, called "TDD e Java: testes automatizados com JUnit".
# How I can start this project?
This is a Java Maven Project that doesn't have any dependencies like Spring Boot or Java FX, just JUnit library that Maven will install for you.
So, you have just import the project as a Maven Project, install the dependencies by Maven and run the tests classes.
